Hi, I'm Alexandra! I plan on putting a better README here later.

In short, I live in the Philadelphia/NYC area and make [video games](https://steam.pm/app/727570) at [Anarkis Gaming](https://www.anarkisgaming.com/) and Web sites (full-stackish) at [Cutie Caf&eacute;](https://cutie.cafe/).

I mainly work with C#, Go, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS; but I also have experience with Python, PHP, Java, Lua, Delphi/Free Pascal, WordPress development, Linux system administration, React, and Vue.

I am available for hire. My Web site and portfolio are available at https://alexandra.is/. If you need to reach me, please send an email to im at alexandra dot moe.
