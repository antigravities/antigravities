Hi, I'm Alexandra! I live in the Philadelphia/NYC area and make video games (at [Anarkis Gaming](https://www.anarkisgaming.com/)), Web sites, and Web sites about video games (at [Cutie Caf&eacute;](https://cutie.cafe/)) - but *not* [video games about Web sites](https://store.steampowered.com/app/844590/Hypnospace_Outlaw/), sorry.

I am a programming polyglot; I love learning and working with lots of different languages, runtimes, and tools. I particularly like working with C#, Go, JavaScript (+ Node.js), and HTML/CSS; and I'd love to work more with Swift and Docker.

I am available for hire! See my portfolio below. If you'd like to get in touch, please email im at alexandra dot moe.
